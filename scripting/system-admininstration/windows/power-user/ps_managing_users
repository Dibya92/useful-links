#TO ADD/REMOVE USER USING CMD NET COMMAND

- To change a password, type "net user (username) *". Don't type the quotes, and do not forget the star.

- To add a user, type "net user (username) /ADD". Don't type the quotes.
  net user [username [password | *] [options]] [/domain]

- To delete a user, type "net user (username) /DELETE". Don't type the quotes.
  net user username [/delete] [/domain]

- Type in "net accounts/?" for help on the net accounts command. You can use this to force log-offs and set expiration times on user accounts.
  If you need to do much more, try typing in all of the suggested net commands with a "/?" at the end. Try looking on a search engine for help on how to use the command.
